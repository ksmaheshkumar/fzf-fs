##### README

[fzf-fs](https://github.com/D630/fzf-fs) acts like a very simple and configurable file browser/navigator for the command line by taking advantage of the general-purpose fuzzy finder [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf). Although coming without Miller columns, fzf-fs is inspired by tools like [lscd](https://github.com/hut/lscd) and [deer](https://github.com/vifon/deer), which both follow the example set by [ranger](https://github.com/hut/ranger).
