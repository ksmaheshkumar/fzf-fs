              e.g. history | fzf --tac --no-sort

       --tiebreak=CRI
              Sort criterion to use when the scores are tied

              length  Prefers item with shorter length
              begin    Prefers  item  with matched substring closer to
              the beginning
              end     Prefers item with matched  substring  closer  to
              the end
              index    Prefers item that appeared earlier in the input
              stream

   Interface
       -m, --multi
              Enable multi-select with tab/shift-tab

       --ansi Enable processing of ANSI color codes

       --no-mouse
              Disable mouse

       --color=COL
              Color scheme: [dark|light|16|bw]
              (default: dark on 256-color terminal, otherwise 16)

              dark    Color scheme for dark 256-color terminal
              light   Color scheme for light 256-color terminal
              16      Color scheme for 16-color terminal
              bw      No colors

       --black

       --reverse
              Reverse orientation

       --no-hscroll
              Disable horizontal scroll

       --inline-info
              Display finder info inline with the query

       --prompt=STR
              Input prompt (default: '> ')

   Scripting
       -q, --query=STR
              Start the finder with the given query

       -1, --select-1
              Automatically select the only match

       -0, --exit-0
              Exit immediately when there's no match

       -f, --filter=STR
              Filter mode. Do not start interactive finder. When  used
              with --no-sort, fzf becomes a fuzzy-version of grep.

       --print-query
              Print query as the first line

       --expect=KEY[,..]
              Comma-separated  list  of  keys  (ctrl-[a-z], alt-[a-z],
              f[1-4], or any single character) that  can  be  used  to
              complete  fzf in addition to the default enter key. When
              this option is set, fzf will print the name of  the  key
              pressed  as the first line of its output (or as the sec‐
              ond line if --print-query is also used). The  line  will
              be empty if fzf is completed with the default enter key.
              e.g. fzf --expect=ctrl-v,ctrl-t,alt-s,f1,f2,~,@

       --toggle-sort=KEY
              Key  to  toggle  sort (ctrl-[a-z], alt-[a-z], f[1-4], or
              any single character)

       --sync Synchronous search for multi-staged filtering. If speci‐
              fied,  fzf  will  launch  ncurses  finder only after the
              input stream is complete.
              e.g. fzf --multi | fzf --sync


ENVIRONMENT
       FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND
              Default command to use when input is tty

       FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS
              Default options. e.g. --extended --ansi


EXIT STATUS
       0      Normal exit
       1      Interrupted with CTRL-C or ESC


FIELD INDEX EXPRESSION
       A field index expression can be a non-zero integer or  a  range
       expression ([BEGIN]..[END]). --nth and --with-nth take a comma-
       separated list of field index expressions.


   Examples
       1      The 1st field
       2      The 2nd field
       -1     The last field
       -2     The 2nd to last field
       3..5   From the 3rd field to the 5th field
       2..    From the 2nd field to the last field
       ..-3   From the 1st field to the 3rd to the last field
       ..     All the fields


EXTENDED SEARCH MODE
       With -x or --extended option,  fzf  will  start  in  "extended-
       search  mode".  In this mode, you can specify multiple patterns
       delimited by spaces, such as: 'wild ^music .mp3$ sbtrkt !rmx


   Exact-match (quoted)
       A term that is prefixed by  a  single-quote  character  (')  is
       interpreted as an "exact-match" (or "non-fuzzy") term. fzf will
       search for the exact occurrences of the string.


   Anchored-match
       A term can be prefixed by ^, or suffixed  by  $  to  become  an
       anchored-match  term.   Then fzf will search for the items that
       start with or end with the given string. An anchored-match term
       is also an exact-match term.


   Negation
       If  a  term  is  prefixed by !, fzf will exclude the items that
       satisfy the term from the result.


   Extended-exact mode
       If you don't need fuzzy matching at all  and  do  not  wish  to
       "quote"  (prefixing  with  ')  every word, start fzf with -e or
       --extended-exact option (instead of -x or --extended).
